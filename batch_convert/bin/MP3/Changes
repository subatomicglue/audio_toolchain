Release Name: 0.92
=======================

Include a fix by Marco Moreno of Cwd::abspath() not working on files (on
some architectures).

Release Name: 0.91
=======================

CDDB_File was removing whitespace on the boundary of continuation fields.

get_user() calls ParseData->parse() to populate the userdata

if $ENV{MP3TAG_TEST_WEAKEN}, will not have a workaround against broken weakrefs
	(currently tests fail!)

New %-escapes v L r q Q S m s C p o u (require MP3::Info module).

New methods mpeg_version() mpeg_layer() mpeg_layer_roman() is_stereo()
is_vbr() bitrate_kbps() frequency_Hz() frequency_kHz() size_bytes()
total_secs() total_secs_int() total_mins() leftover_secs()
leftover_msec() time_mm_ss() is_copyrighted() is_copyrighted_YN()
frames_padded() frames_padded_YN() channel_mode_int() frames()
frame_len() vbr_scale() (require MP3::Info module).

The year() method of ID3v2 takes/returns timestamps in human-readable form;
parse() recognizes the same formats for %y if option year_is_timestamp is TRUE
(default).

New option 'intact' to get_frame() of ID3v2.

Support YEAR, ID3Y, ID3G in EXTD, EXTT* fields of CDDB_File.  Support also
an alternative syntax "Recorded"/"Recorded on"/"Recorded in"/ with the format
of the date recognized by ID3v2::year(), or just a date field without a prefix.
The declarations of the former form are stripped from the returned comment.

New fields artist_collection, title_track, comment_collection, comment_track
in CDDB_File and corresponding accessor methods in MP3::Tag, and corresponding
escapes aC, tT, cC, cT for interpolate().

New configuration variables 'year_is_timestamp', 'comment_remove_date',
'translate_*' (for different values of *).

New handler module LastResort; currently it uses artist_collection() as comment
if comment is not otherwise defined.

New example scripts audio_rename and mod/Music_Translate_Fields.pm.

The example script mp3info2 will use Music_Translate_Fields.pm (if found)
to postprocess the resulting tag fields via translate_*() methods.

Do not load Compress::Zlib unless when processing compressed data.

Release Name: 0.9
=======================

Revision history for Perl modules MP3::Tag, MP3::Tag::ID3v1, MP3::Tag::ID3v2, MP3::Tag::File,
             and for Perl program tk-tag

Changes:

* Bugfix for ID3v2.pm:
  - Added support for reading ID3v2.2 and ID3v2.4 tags (alpha stage!!) and converting them to ID3v2.3
  - Bugfix for unsynchronization (thanks to Ian Beckwith)
  - Bugfix for number-handling in frames
  - Bugfix for frame compression
  - Set unsynchronization flag only, if unsynchronization was done and changed anything

* Bugfix for ID3v1.pm:
  - genres didn't return the id if the genre name was passed as parameter, but returned
    the same name

* Makefile.PL:
  - overriding the manifypods() function in MakeMaker to add ID3v2-Data.pod to the MAN3PODS hash
    (thanks to Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsaker)

* Added copyright text, using Perl Artistic License

Thanks to Ilya Zakharevich for the following changes:

* Three new modules MP3::Tag::Inf, MP3::Tag::ParseData, and
  MP3::Tag::CDDB_File added

* Tag.pm:
  - autoinfo() method returns the info for all ID3v1 tags;
  - autoinfo() method may return the info which tag is obtained from
    which source;
  - Methods title(), author() etc (one per each ID3v1 tag) exist and
    have uniform interface through all the subpackages;
  - method song() is renamed to title(); method read_filename() is
    renamed to parse_filename(); backward compatible name still
    preserved;
  - config() subroutine can now change all the arbitrary decisions;
  - new methods interpolate() for tag interpolation into strings and
    parse(), parse_rex() for an inverse operation;
  - new subpackage `__hasparent' to treat cyclic object dependencies;
  - per-object configuration;
  - new configuration options extension, parse_data, parse_split,
    parse_filename_ignore_case, parse_filename_merge_dots, parse_join;
  - a way to store and query user-supplied data inside the object (may
    be used as scratch space when parsing);
  - new methods get_config(), get_user(), set_user(), parse_prepare(),
    parse_rex_prepare(), parse_rex_match(), filename(), abs_filename(),
    filename_nodir(), filename_noextension(), filename_nodir_noextension(),
    abs_filename_noextension(), dirname(), filename_extension(),
    filename_extension_nodot(), dir_component().

* ID3v1.pm:
  - new ID3v1 method fits_tags() to check whether the info can be
    placed into an ID3v1 tag
  - If no track given use automatically ID3v1.0 tag with longer comment
  - open() file if needed; do not close() close during new().

* ID3v2.pm:
  - allow multiple frames to be returned by get_frame() in ID3v2;
  - new method get_frames() with better order of returned values (comparing
    to get_frame);
  - get_frame_ids() in ID3v2 improved to take new argument 'truename' to
    simplify looping over repeated frames;
  - simpler treatement of sync; fix uncorrect calculation of padding length;
  - overwrite the tail of the previously present tag with 0s;
  - a couple of new v2.4 field names added.

* File.pm:
  - more robust parsing of filenames; year can be read from filename if
    appended (in parentheses) to author or title; filename can be
    F<.wav> as well.
  - support file names starting with track numbers as in 03_This_is_the_title.mp3
  - support track_title.ext and title_track.ext formats with one-word title too.
  - new method filename();
  - use the 'extension' configuration variable to strip extension.

* misprints in the docs corrected and some general harmonization of function and
  field names in the different modules

* new example script mp3info2 (which provides most of functionality of the
  "standard" mp3info utility, and much more).

Release Name: 0.40
==================
Changes:

* Updated documentation for MP3::Tag, MP3::Tag::ID3v1, MP3::Tag::ID3v2 and MP3::Tag::ID3v2-Data 

* Renamed some functions. The old names will still work, but try to use the new names.
  The following names were changed: 

  - MP3::Tag::getTags() to MP3::Tag::get_tags() 
  - MP3::Tag::newTag() to MP3::Tag::new_tag() 
  - MP3::Tag::ID3v1::removeTag() to MP3::Tag::ID3v1::remove_tag() 
  - MP3::Tag::ID3v1::writeTag() to MP3::Tag::ID3v1::write_tag() 
  - MP3::Tag::ID2v2::getFrameIDs() to MP3::Tag::ID3v2::get_frame_ids() 
  - MP3::Tag::ID2v2::getFrame() to MP3::Tag::ID3v2::get_frame() 
  
* Bugfix for ID3v2.pm:
  - getFrame() returned "undef" as a string instead of simple undef
  - artist() produced an error when TPE1 is missing in TAG
 
* Bugfix for Tag.pm:
  - DESTROY() checked only if $mp3->obj{filename} exists and not if it is defined before trying to 
    close it  

* Bugfix for ID3v1.pm:
  - genres() expected an id3v1-object as first parameter and a genre
    only as second parameter. Now the object can be omitted as in a call like
    MP3::Tag::ID3v1->genres($genre) used by Tag.pm and ID3v2.pm

* bugfix for File.pm:
  - Filenames may contain surrounding whitespaces now

Release Name: 0.30
==================
Changes:
* Tag.pm
  - autoinfo() function added. This returns artist/songtitle/track/album.
    It tries to find this information in an ID3v1 or ID3v2 tag or tries 
    to extract it from the filename. The order in which this happens
    can be configured with the new config() function.
* ID3v2.pm
  - four new functions: artist(), song(), track() and album(). These
    are included for compability with the ID3v1 and filename module.
* Tag.pm / Tag::File.pm
  - All file access routines are collected in an extra modul now.
    This prevents circular references between Tag.pm and the ID3v..pm
    modules. These circular references prevented Perl from calling
    the destructor for mp3-objects.
* tk-tag
  - Loading/Saving of binary data in frame-fields is supported now
  - tk-tag uses now the new what_data functionally of ID3v2 to offer 
    BrowseEntrys for TCON and TFLT and also for parts of APIC and COMR
  - Set Filename uses now the actual contents of the Tags not the old 
    saved one
  - Set Filename from ID3v2-Tag works now at least with Artist (%a),
    Album(%l) and Song (%s)
* ID3v2::what_data returns now also information about possible restricted
  input for some frame fields (APIC; TCON; COMR; TFLT are supported yet).

Release Name: 0.25
==================
Changes:

* Bug-fix for MP3::Tag
  If you created several mp3-objects for different files, the filehandles
  for each file were not used correctly. Thanks to hakimian for reporting
  this bug.
* Bug-fix for ID3v2::remove_tag()
  It was tried twice to rename one temp-file after removing the tag.
  Thanks to Brent Sarten <bsarten@bigfoot.com> for reporting this.
* Bug-fix for ID3v2::add_tag()
  When adding a second (or third, ...) frame of a kind, a wrong header
  could be written for this frame
* Bug-fix for tk-tag 
  When opening a new file, the contents of the ID3v2 tag of the last file
  would be copied to the ID3v2 tag of the new file for all frames which
  existed in the last file, but not in the new one.

Release Name: 0.21
==================
Changes:

* tk-tag has lots of new functions (see tk-tag README)
* getFrameIDs returns now always a hash ref of all existing frames, not only
  when called the first time
* Some minor problems in documentation are corrected.
* ID3v2::add_frame returns the name of the newly created frame, which can
  differ from the short name when already such a frame exists.

Release Name: 0.20 (beta)
========================
Changes:

--due to problems when run at windows:
  * Added a second seek to ID3v1::write_tag, as windows writes at a wrong 
    position otherwise
  * Setting Filehandle to binmode after opening a mp3 file 
  * ID3v2: write_tag creates a temp file (if neccessary) now in the same
    directory where the original mp3 files is located and not in /tmp

* Added tk-tag.pl, a graphical interface for MP3::Tag. tk-tag.pl is a alpha
  version
* Added a new manpage MP3::Tag::ID3v2-Data which contains information about
  the ID3v2 frames and the data returned by MP3::Tag::Id3v2::getFrame() 
* Frames RVRB ("Reverb"), COMR ("Commercial frame"), AENC ("Audio encryption"),
  GRID ("Group identification registration"), RBUF ("Recommended buffer size")
  and SYTC ("Synchronized lyric/text") are now supported	
* Added some test to test.pl for creating new tags
* ID3v2::getFrameIDs returns now a hash reference, which contains the found
  frames. The keys are the 4 byte codes of the frames, which are needed for
  getFrame . The according values are the english (long) names of the frames.
* ID3v2::write_tag - Updating tagsize after writing tag 
* ID3v1::all() returns in array context all fields, otherwise only the song
* MP3::ID3v1::write_tag didn't returned an error if a file couldn't be opened
  for writing. Now it does.
* Renamed MP3::TAG to MP3::Tag following a suggestion of ANDK from CPAN
* Makefile.PL : Added that Compress::Zlib and File::Basename is needed for 
  installation of MP3::Tag

Release Name: 0.1 (beta)
========================
Changes:
* Added documentation to the modules

* Writing/removing of ID3v2.3 tags is supported now 
* Adding, changing, removing frames of ID3v2.3 is supported

* Changed directory structure
* Added file for proper install of modules


Release Name: 0.2-alpha
=======================
Changes: 
* ID3v2.3 compressed frames are supported now 
* changed directory structure, support librarys for MP3::Tag are now in a
  subdirectory 
* tagged.pl calls xview to show pictures, which were found in ID3v2 tags
  (sorry, not configurable at the moment, but easy to change in tagged.pl)

Release Name: 0.1-alpha
=======================
This is the first alpha version. It contains perl modules to
read ID3v1/ID3v2 tags, but they are still lacking a lot of
features. 

* Reading / Writing ID3v1 works
* Reading of most frames of ID3v2.3 works

Included is a demo program tagged.pl, and a program to change ID3v1
tags and to set automatically the filename of a mp3 file: tagit.pl See
README.txt for details. More documentation is still lacking. Sorry.

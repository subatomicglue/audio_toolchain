                           MP3::Tag
============================================================

This is a perl module to read/write ID3v1, ID3v1.1 and ID3v2.3
tags of mp3-files. (Other tags hopefully to follow).

To install the MP3::TAG module you simply do:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install   (as root)

If you find some errors while doing this, please send me
an email describing the problems.

You need to have the modules Compress::Zlib and File::Basename
installed. If you are missing one of these (perl Makefile.PL 
should warn you) you can find them on CPAN (www.cpan.org).

In the directory examples, you find 4 examples, how to use
the module. You can read the documentation of this
module with 

man MP3::Tag
man MP3::Tag::ID3v1
man MP3::Tag::ID3v2
man MP3::Tag::ID3v2-Data

Success with this

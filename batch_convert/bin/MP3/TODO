MP3::Tag.pm
===========

* perhaps restructuring of this wrapper module, as it 
  should be easier to say which Tag::modules should be used

* more testing

MP3::Tag::ID3v1.pm
==================

* more testing



MP3::Tag::ID3v2.pm
==================

* Encryption of frames (read and write)

* Only first tag in front of file is read, tags inside mp3-data are ignored

* Following frames are only supported in RAW mode:
  - EQUA -> Equalization
  - ETCO -> Event timing codes
  - MLLT -> MPEG location lookup table
  - POSS -> Position synchronisation frame
  - SYLT -> Synchronized tempo codes
  - RVAD -> Relative volume adjustment

* more testing

* reading of frames is very strict following rules of ID3v2 definition, but
  a lot of programs seem to do this not, so some frames are not read right
  (eg TMED of contains 'DIG, MD' instead of '(DIG/MD)', but only
  '(DIG/MD)' is returned correctly as 'Other Digital Media, MiniDisc'
  'DIG, MD' is returned as 'DIG, MD'

* frames like TMED who have to be specially encoded, are doing this only
  when the frame is read, not when it is written
